## FAQ

#### What is Queue?

- A linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
- The order is First In First Out (FIFO), which means that the element that is inserted first in the queue will be the first one to be removed from the queue. 
- A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer who came first is served first.

#### What are Operations on Queue?

- Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- Front: Get the front item from queue.
- Rear: Get the last item from queue.
